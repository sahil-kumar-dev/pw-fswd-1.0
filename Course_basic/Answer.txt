Question 1: What is HTML?

Answer: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. It is a markup language that structures content on the internet. HTML uses a system of tags to define the various elements and components of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. These tags provide structure and semantics to the content, allowing web browsers to render it properly. HTML is the backbone of web development and is often used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create modern, interactive web experiences.

Question 2: What is CSS?

Answer: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It provides a way to separate the content of a web page from its visual representation. With CSS, you can control the styling of elements, including their colors, fonts, positioning, and responsiveness to different screen sizes. CSS allows web developers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across web pages and is an essential part of web development, working in tandem with HTML.

Question 3: Why did JavaScript come into the picture?

Answer: JavaScript came into the picture to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Originally, web pages were static, and HTML was primarily responsible for rendering content. However, as the internet evolved, there was a growing need for more interactive and responsive web applications. JavaScript was developed to meet this need.

JavaScript allows developers to:

Create interactive features like form validation, image sliders, and interactive menus.
Dynamically update content on a web page without requiring a full page reload.
Make asynchronous requests to servers for data without disrupting the user experience (AJAX).
Build web applications, including games and complex user interfaces.
In essence, JavaScript empowers web developers to create richer and more user-friendly web experiences by adding functionality that goes beyond what HTML and CSS can offer.

Question 4: History of JavaScript and ECMAScript (in my own words):

Answer: JavaScript, originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in 1995, was created to provide interactivity in web browsers. It quickly gained popularity as it allowed developers to add client-side scripting capabilities to web pages.

In the early days, different web browsers implemented JavaScript with slight variations, leading to compatibility issues. To address this, the JavaScript language standardization effort resulted in the creation of ECMAScript, which is the official specification of the language. ECMAScript helps ensure consistency and interoperability across different JavaScript implementations.

Over the years, JavaScript and ECMAScript have gone through multiple versions and updates. Key milestones include ECMAScript 3 (1999), which brought significant improvements and broad adoption, and ECMAScript 5 (2009), which introduced features like strict mode and native JSON support.
